# Contact Center Analytics Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze contact center performance, focusing on metrics such as Average Handle Time (AHT), queue channel, sentiments , call reason, and service level adherence. The analysis will help in making data-supported decisions regarding agent skill routing between chat and inbound queues and gather insights for improving service levels to ensure they are met at each interval of the day.

## Objectives
- Analyze how AHT relates to call-in reasons or case issues over time.
- Make data-supported decisions in agent skill routing between chat and inbound queues.
- Gather insights for service level (SL) improvements to ensure targets are met at each interval of the day.
- Develop interactive visualizations and reports using Power BI to present the findings.

## Data Generation
The project involves generating synthetic data to simulate the operations of a contact center. The following tables are created:

### Data Generation Script
The data generation script creates synthetic data for the above tables. [Link to script](path/to/script).

## Analysis Plan
### AHT Analysis
- Group AHT by call reason and visualize how it changes over time (monthly, daily, hourly).
- Compare AHT across different interaction types (Chat, Inbound-Member, Inbound-All).

### Agent Performance
- Evaluate agent performance based on AHT, hold times, and after-call work durations.
- Identify agents with high AHT and provide targeted training or skill adjustments.

### Queue Performance
- Analyze queue metrics to identify periods of high wait times and abandonment rates.
- Adjust staffing levels or routing strategies based on queue performance data.

### Service Level Analysis
- Assess service level performance across different intervals.
- Identify intervals with low service level adherence and suggest improvements.

## Visualizations and Reporting
Using Power BI, create the following visualizations:
- **AHT Trends:** Time series graphs showing AHT by call reason, interaction type, and agent.
- **Service Level Performance:** Dashboards showing service level adherence and areas for improvement.
- **Queue Metrics:** Visualizations highlighting wait times, abandonment rates, and queue volumes.

### Power BI Functionalities
- **DAX Formulas:** Use DAX formulas to create measures and calculated columns. Examples include:

  - **Week Order:**
    ```DAX
    Week Order = WEEKDAY(DateMaster[Date])
    ```

  - **Day:**
    ```DAX
    Day = FORMAT(DateMaster[Date],"DDD")
    ```

  - **Date Master:**
    ```DAX
   DateMaster = CALENDAR(MIN('Call Center (Cleaned)'[call_timestamp]),
MAX('Call Center (Cleaned)'[call_timestamp]))
    ```

  - **Total Calls:**
    ```DAX    
Total Calls = COUNT('Call Center (Cleaned)'[id])
   ```

  - **Total Call Duration:**
    ```DAX
    Total Call Duration (Min) = SUM('Call Center (Cleaned)'[call duration in minutes])
    ```

  - **Total Call Duration in Hrs:**
    ```DAX
    Total Call Duration (Hrs) = [Total Call Duration (Min)]/60
    ```

  - **Week Order:**
    ```DAX
    Ave Call Duration (Min) = AVERAGE('Call Center (Cleaned)'[call duration in minutes])
    ```

  - **Response Time Percentage:**
    ```DAX
    Response Time Percentage = 
VAR WithinSLA = SUMX(
    'Call Center (Cleaned)',
    IF([response_time] = "Within SLA", 1, 0)
)
VAR AboveSLA = SUMX(
    'Call Center (Cleaned)',
    IF([response_time] = "Above SLA", 1, 0)
)
VAR TotalCalls = COUNTROWS('Call Center (Cleaned)')
RETURN 
    DIVIDE(
        WithinSLA + AboveSLA,
        TotalCalls
    )
    ```

- **Visualizations:** Utilize various chart types such as line charts, bar charts, and tables for effective data presentation.

### Excel Functionalities
- **Pivot Tables:** Create pivot tables to summarize data and identify trends.
- **Charts:** Use Excel charts to visualize data insights.
- **Formulas:** Utilize Excel formulas for additional calculations, such as:
  - **SUMIF, AVERAGEIF** to calculate metrics based on conditions.

## Insights and Recommendations
### Insights
- **AHT by Call Reason:** Identify which call reasons have the highest AHT and focus on reducing handle times for these categories.
- **Service Level Performance:** Highlight intervals with low service level adherence and investigate underlying causes.
- **Queue Metrics:** Analyze high wait times and abandonment rates to optimize staffing levels and improve customer satisfaction.

### Recommendations
- **Agent Training:** Provide targeted training to agents with high AHT or low performance metrics.
- **Staffing Adjustments:** Adjust staffing levels during peak intervals to ensure service level targets are met.
- **Process Improvements:** Implement process improvements for call reasons with high AHT to streamline handling times.

## Limitations
- **Synthetic Data:** The analysis is based on synthetic data, which may not capture all real-world complexities.
- **Tool Access:** Limited access to advanced analytics tools may restrict the depth of analysis.
- **Generalization:** Insights and recommendations are based on simulated scenarios and may need adaptation for real-world application.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of contact center performance, focusing on key metrics such as AHT, hold times, and service level adherence. The insights gained from this analysis will help in optimizing agent skill routing and improving overall service levels, ensuring that customer satisfaction is maintained.

## Future Work
- **Real-time Data Analysis:** Integrate real-time data analysis for more dynamic decision-making.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Implement machine learning models to predict interaction volumes and required staffing levels.
- **Expanded Metrics:** Include additional metrics such as agent adherence and schedule efficiency.
